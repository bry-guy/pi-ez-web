# web

The site you open: chats, the sidebar, settings, model and GitHub sign-in. It is `node server/index.js` from the pi-ez-web image (the image's default command), listening on port 3141.

Without workspaced, web runs projects itself in its own process. That is the one-container quick start. With `PI_WEB_WORKSPACED_URL` set, every project lives in a worker, and web only proxies to it.

## Configure

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PI_WEB_HOME` | `~/.pi-web-ui` | App state: `config.json`, chat bindings, the GitHub login, the snapshot cache of worker projects |
| `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` | `~/.pi/agent` | Pi's directory: model logins (`auth.json`) and sessions |
| `HOME`, `XDG_*_HOME` | | Keep on the persistent volume so tools and caches survive restarts |
| `PI_WEB_WORKSPACED_URL` | unset | Base URL of workspaced. Setting it moves projects to workers |
| `WORKSPACED_TOKEN` | unset | Bearer token for workspaced. Must match workspaced's token |
| `PI_WEB_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` / `PI_WEB_GITHUB_TOKEN` | unset | GitHub sign-in (public OAuth client ID) or a fixed token. See [Configuration](configuration.md) |
| `PI_WEB_PRESTART_COMMAND` | unset | Shell run before start, e.g. fetching dotfiles or seeding `config.json` (120 s limit) |
| `PI_SYNC_SERVER_URL` | unset | Optional [pi-sync](https://github.com/bry-guy/pi-sync) server |

Everything else (default model, Pi profile and packages, repository source) is in **Settings** or [`config.json`](configuration.md).

## Chat header

The whole header row of a project conversation opens the session panel (below), wherever you tap it; the sidebar and Files buttons and the sync label keep their own taps. The header's left button toggles the sidebar (a panel glyph; a hamburger on a phone) and the right button toggles the file tree (a `</>` code glyph). The sidebar's footer row is the settings button.

Async results (fetch, pull, a hook finishing) are announced as a short toast at the bottom of the screen, and disappear after a few seconds.

Visual tokens live at the top of `public/app.css`: radius (`--radius-sm` … `--radius-pill`), space (`--space-1` … `--space-6`), type (`--text-xs` … `--text-xl`) and one motion duration (`--duration`, 150 ms). New components use them rather than literal values. Buttons: `.btn-primary` (one per view), `.btn-secondary`, `.btn-caution` (destructive; always confirms), `.btn-ghost`.

The header's second line shows the project's Git context (branch · commit · clean, dirty or unknown, with ↑ahead and ↓behind) and, on the same line, the conversation's sync state as one label, `<state>: <message>`: `Synced: up to date`, `In use: <device>`, `Sync error: <reason>`, or `Sync: <status>` when it is not synchronized. Tap the label, or hover it, for the full detail. On a phone the line stays one line and ends in an ellipsis.

## Chat activity

While a turn runs, the chat shows a small dot spinner (a 2×3 grid of dots, every one of which lights in turn) and one live line: the extension's working message (for example from pi-summarize), else the current tool (`Reading files.js…`, `Running npm test…`), else `Thinking…`. Tool calls and thinking are not shown inline. When the turn ends, a quiet row reads `Worked 42s · 6 steps ›`. Tapping it opens **Steps** in place of the chat, with a `<` back button and a `#steps=…` address, so Back returns to the chat at the same scroll position. Steps lists pi-summarize summaries, each expandable to the thinking and tool calls behind it; a turn without summaries lists its tool calls and thinking in order. Thinking is kept with the message, so it is available after a reload.

Untitled chats are named by their first prompt. A chat that was never prompted or named, and is not open, is left out of the sidebar; its file is kept.

## Files

**Files** (the header's `</>` button) lists the project's tree beside the chat; on a phone it covers the whole screen, and its `>` closes it. Folders come first; among folders and among files, dot-names (`.github`, `.env`) come first. **Settings → Appearance → Show hidden files** (on by default, stored in this browser) hides every name that starts with a dot. Tapping a file replaces the chat pane with the file and a `<` that returns to the chat at the same scroll position; browser Back does the same (the address becomes `#file/<path>`). On a phone the file fills the screen and the tree is hidden until you return. Escape also returns to the chat.

The viewer follows the theme: a light code palette in light mode, a dark one in dark mode. Highlighting is server-side (highlight.js, including Dockerfiles). A file with changes against the diff target opens as its diff: added and removed lines keep their green and red backgrounds, and the code on every line is highlighted (removed lines from the base version, the rest from the working file).

## Session panel

Tap the chat header to open the session panel; it is a modal with a `×` (full screen on a phone). It has three sections:

- **Session**: **Fork…** and **Setup**, each with a line saying what it does, plus any other project hooks. **Fork…** opens a step asking for a name and a branch; left empty, the name is the session's name plus the first free `(fork)`, `(fork 2)`, … among the project's sessions, and the branch is derived from that name (made unique). The copy gets its own worktree and opens; this session stays where it is. **Setup** runs the project's setup script (for example `npm ci`) in this worktree. Sync facts appear here when the conversation is shared.
- **Git**: branch, commit, workspace and status, then **Fetch**, **Pull**, **Push** and **Switch…** on the right, and **Delete** (caution, asks first) and **Merge to main** (primary, asks first) for a non-primary branch. **Switch…** opens a step listing the branches (the current one is marked) and a field for a new branch; choosing one moves this session onto it.
- **History**: what ran in this workspace, newest first: setup and other hooks, fetches, pulls, pushes, merges, forks and switches, each with its time, status and output (tap an entry to expand it). An operation still running is listed at the top until it finishes; results are also announced as a toast. A switch or merge is logged both where the session was and where it lands, a fork in both the source and the copy. The log is append-only JSON lines in the app state dir, one file per workspace path, capped at 16 KB of output per entry. Removing the state dir removes the log. It records operations run by the process that serves the request.

Steps show a `<` that returns to the panel's main screen. The panel keeps its frame while its contents update, so it does not flash or re-animate.

Starting a new session uses the same panel with name and branch fields instead of the Session and History sections, and lists earlier sessions under **Sessions**.

## Settings

**Settings** lists its categories on the left (on a phone, first): Providers, Pi, Workers, Sync, Repositories, Defaults, Appearance, Diagnostics. Each category has its own address (`#settings/workers`, `#settings/pi`, …), so reloading or using Back returns to it. `<` returns to the chat, and on a phone `<` on a category returns to the list. Settings has one header: while it is open the chat header steps aside, so there is a single `<` and a single title. Providers and Diagnostics explain what each card shows; Diagnostics lists the build, the mode, what Pi loaded and any load errors, then the server logs.

- **Pi**: the dotfiles profile, extra packages to load, and local extension paths (advanced), with what Pi loaded and any problems. **Save & reload** fetches the profile, installs missing packages, and reloads idle sessions. It is refused while a session is running; stop it first.
- **Workers** (needs workspaced; otherwise the page says workers are not enabled): each worker's state (asleep, starting, awake, busy), keep-awake, last use, resource requests and limits, live usage (`n/a` when workspaced reports none), and its grant: name, service account, namespace, egress, runtime class, and environment variable names (never values). **Reload** re-reads one worker's profile and extensions; **Reload all awake workers** does every awake worker and lists each result. **Restart** starts a fresh pod and reruns startup; the disk is kept. **Reset** wipes the worker's disk and needs its name typed; add the project again afterwards. A busy or asleep worker refuses restart and reset, and the page says why. The page refreshes every 5 seconds while it is visible.
- The sidebar shows each project's worker state; a small dot marks a worker kept awake. A worker that crashed shows an amber state; one that cannot run (crash loop, out of memory, unschedulable, stuck starting) shows **restart** in red, and tapping it restarts the worker. The reason is in its tooltip, and [Worker](worker.md#when-a-worker-breaks) explains recovery.

`mise run dev` (mock mode) shows three fixed sample workers, so the Workers page can be tried without a cluster.

## Logins reach workers

When you sign in to GitHub or a model provider, web sends the login to workspaced (`PUT /v1/github-auth`, `PUT /v1/model-auth`), and workspaced hands it to every worker read-only. Every worker can therefore read those logins. You sign in once, in web.

## Security

web has no authentication. Anyone who can reach it can run commands as its user, and through workspaced, in every worker. Put it behind an authenticating, streaming-capable reverse proxy on a private network. See [Deployment](deployment.md).
